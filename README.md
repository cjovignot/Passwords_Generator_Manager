## Generate passwords
You can generate 1 password (1), or many passwords (2).

For each password to generate, you have to choose :
- The Website you're creating an account on
- The email you're using for your new account

**If the program finds an account already corresponding to the data you typed, it will display all infos you need before exiting.**

Then, you have to choose if you want a random password (1), or a custom one (2) if you just want to add an existing account to your password database.

### Example using both ways of generating passwords

After generating all passwords, program will quit.

## How to search a password
If you need to retrieve a password you already registered, just select the (1) option in the first menu.
First, type the website you're looking for, and then the email linked to this website.
It will return you the desired informations.

## how to edit your passwords
To make the program easier to use, the edit function will allow you to modify your passwords already saved.
To do that, select the option (3) in the first menu.

It will allow you to generate a new random password (1), or to type your own custom password (2).

Selecting the option (1), it will perform exactly as the generating function as before.
Selecting the option (2), you just will have to type the password you need as the custom password function as before.
